title: Memory by Aictx documentation
description: Public documentation for local, reviewable, auto-maintained project memory for AI coding agents and assistants.
---

Memory by Aictx provides local, reviewable, auto-maintained project memory for
AI coding agents. It is distributed through the open source npm package
`@aictx/memory` and the Aictx Homebrew tap, then runs through the `memory` CLI
and optional `memory-mcp` server.

Memory gives coding agents a project memory they can return to.

Use it when a new coding session should not need the same briefing again:
product intent, architecture choices, repo conventions, setup steps, known
traps, and useful source-backed summaries. Memory stores that context as local,
reviewable files under `.memory/`, then builds a focused memory pack for the
task in front of the agent.

The loop is small:

```text
load relevant memory -> do the work -> save what future agents should remember
```

Core memory commands run locally. They do not require a cloud account,
embeddings, hosted sync, external model API, or network access.

This project is distributed as the npm package `@aictx/memory` and the
Homebrew formula `aictx/tap/memory`.

## What Memory is for

Memory is for durable project context that should survive across agents,
sessions, branches, and reviews.

It helps a coding agent answer two questions:

- Before work: what matters for this task?
- After work: what should future agents not have to rediscover?

Good memory is useful on a later day. It can capture a decision, a workflow, a
gotcha, an open question, a source record, or a compact synthesis of a larger
area such as product intent, architecture, feature maps, conventions, roadmap,
or agent guidance.

:::tip
A good first memory is something future agents can use: "release smoke tests run
with `pnpm test:local`", "billing webhooks retry in the worker", or "the viewer
can inspect memory and export Obsidian projections".
:::

## How it works

1. The agent loads task-focused project memory.
2. The agent does the work using the repo, tests, and conversation as evidence.
3. The agent saves only durable context that should be active next time.

Memory keeps that memory local, explicit, and reviewable.

## Choose your path

- New to Memory: start with [Getting started](/getting-started/) to install,
  initialize a repo, and run the first load/save/diff loop.
- Using Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, OpenCode, or MCP-capable clients:
  use [Agent recipes](/agent-recipes/) for copyable setup prompts.
- Trying to keep agent instruction files small: read the
  [Mental model](/mental-model/) and [Specializing Memory](/specializing-memory/)
  to separate behavior guidance from durable project knowledge.
- Want reviewable local memory: use [Capabilities](/capabilities/) for the
  load, inspect, diff, viewer, audit, and repair workflows.
- Managing repeated or multi-project agent work: use
  [Memory Recipes](/memory-recipes/) and [Wiki workflow](/wiki-workflow/) to
  capture product intent, architecture, workflows, gotchas, and source-backed
  syntheses.
- Adding MCP later: read the [MCP guide](/mcp/) after the CLI workflow is clear.

## First-time setup prompt

Copy this prompt into [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli),
[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup),
[Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai), or another coding
agent from the project root:

```text
Set up fresh Memory for this repository.

Install Memory with one of:
brew install aictx/tap/memory
npm install -g @aictx/memory

Then run:
memory setup
memory check
memory load "onboard to this repository"

When this is done, report:
- whether setup wrote memory
- whether check passed
- how I can inspect the result with `memory view` or `memory diff`
```

## Start here

- [Getting started](/getting-started/) installs Memory, initializes a repo, and
  walks through the first load/save/diff loop.
- [Capabilities](/capabilities/) maps the main commands to the jobs users and
  agents actually need to do.
- [Mental model](/mental-model/) explains canonical memory, generated state,
  retrieval, and how Memory fits beside agent instruction files.
- [Wiki workflow](/wiki-workflow/) covers source-backed ingestion and maintained
  syntheses.
- [Specializing Memory](/specializing-memory/) shows how to shape memory for your
  repo's product, workflows, and agent guidance.
- [Memory Recipes](/memory-recipes/) gives copyable prompts for product,
  architecture, debugging, workflow, source-backed, and repair memory.
- [Agent integration](/agent-integration/) gives agents the concrete workflow
  and safety rules.
- [Agent recipes](/agent-recipes/) gives copyable setup prompts for Codex,
  Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, OpenCode, and MCP-capable clients.

## CLI and MCP

Use the CLI by default. Configure MCP when your agent client already supports
tool servers and you want the routine load/search/inspect/save/diff actions
inside the client.

For exact tool names and boundaries, see the [MCP guide](/mcp/) and
[Reference](/reference/).

## For agents

This site is also published with agent-readable documentation files:

- `/llms.txt`
- `/llms-full.txt`
- `/llms-small.txt`

These files provide compact public documentation for coding agents without
crawling the full website navigation.

## Project health

The public repository includes contributor guidelines, a code of conduct,
security reporting instructions, support paths, a public roadmap, a release
policy, CI, CodeQL, OpenSSF Scorecard, and Dependabot configuration. See the
repository root for the maintained community and release files.
